## Control 6.3.3.x - Audit template
# This variable governs if the auditd logic should be executed(if value is true).
# NOTE: The current default value is likely to be overridden(via 'set_fact') by other further tasks(in sub-section 'Auditd rules').

## Usage on containerized images
# The role discovers dynamically (in tasks/main.yml) whether it
# is executed on a container image and sets the variable
# system_is_container the true. Otherwise, the default value
# 'false' is left unchanged.

# firewall-type).
