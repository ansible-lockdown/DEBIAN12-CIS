# This variable is used for running the OS validation check.
# Supported OSs will not need for this to be changed - see README e.g. CentOS
os_check: true

## Possibly disruptive tasks
# This variable governs whether tasks of a potentially disruptive nature on your system
# (e.g., removing .forward and .netrc files for interactive users) are carried out.
# If you set this variable to 'true', the role will carry such tasks; if you set it to
# 'false', these tasks will be skipped.
deb12cis_disruption_high: true

## Switching on/off specific baseline sections
# These variables govern whether the tasks of a particular section are to be executed when running the role.
# E.g: If you want to execute the tasks of Section 1 you should set the '_section1' variable to 'true'.
# If you do not want the tasks from that section to get executed you simply set the variable to 'false'.

## Section 1.6 - Mandatory Access Control
# This variable governs whether SELinux is disabled or not. If SELinux is NOT DISABLED by setting
# 'deb12cis_selinux_disable' to 'true', the 1.6 subsection will be executed.
deb12cis_selinux_disable: false
# This variable is used in a preliminary task, handling grub2 paths either in case of

## Benchmark name and profiles used by auditing control role
# The audit variable found at the base
benchmark: DEBIAN12-CIS
benchmark_version: '1.0.1'

## Reboot system before audit
# System will reboot if false, can give better audit results
skip_reboot: true

## This variable's value defaults to 'false'.
# If there are tasks that require a reboot they will notify a handler
# that sets this variable's value to 'true'. The rebooting task
# is triggered by this variable, and only executes if this var's
# value is set to 'true' and if the 'skip_reboot' variable is 'false'.
# If 'skip_reboot' is set to 'true', the rebooting task will display
# a warning message.

## Control 1.1.1.8 - Ensure udf kernel module is not available

# usb-storage will fail to be removed which is control 1.1.1.8. By default, this
# is set to false. By having this set to false control 1.1.1.8 will run but if UAS
# is loaded you will receive a warning message instead of usb-storage being removed
# and the playbook will have to be re-run with this switch set to true.
# Default: false
deb12cis_uas_remove: false

## Ability to enable debug on mounts to assist in troubleshooting.
# Mount point changes are set based upon facts created in Prelim,
# these then build the variable and options that is passed to the handler to set the
# mount point for the controls in section 1.

# These /tmp settings will include nosuid,nodev,noexec to conform to CIS standards.
deb12cis_tmp_svc: false

## Controls 1.3.1.x - apparmor
# AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access and their privileges.
# This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user.

## Controls 1.3.1.3 and 1.3.1.4 Ensure all AppArmor Profiles are in enforce (1.3.1.3/4) or complain (1.3.1.3) mode

# This variable disables the implementation of rules 1.3.1.1, 1.3.1.2,
# 1.3.1.3 and 1.3.1.4. These refer to ensuring that AppArmor is installed,
# that it is enabled in the bootloader configuration and that profiles are enforced
# or put in complain mode.

# and sets `enforce` mode, no matter what this variable's value is.

# updated in order for the changes made by them to be fully
# implemented. Therefore, those tasks are setting this variable's
# value to 'true' so as to execute the needed update!
deb12cis_sysctl_update: false


# The following variable is responsible for the execution of a

# "suspend" - the system suspends recording audit events until more space is available;
# "single"  - the audit daemon will put the computer system in single user mode;

# CIS prescribes either `halt` or `single`.

## Control 7.1.11 - Ensure world writable files and directories are secured
# The following variable is a toggle for enabling/disabling the automated
# removal of world-writable permissions from all files.
# Possible values are `true` and `false`.
deb12cis_no_world_write_adjust: true

## Control 7.1.12 - Ensure no files or directories without an owner and a group exist
# This variable hold the part of the command that helps detect which files and
# directories do not have an owner and an affiliated group.

deb12cis_unowned_owner: root
# The value of this variable specifies the group that will be set for ungrouped files and directories.
deb12cis_ungrouped_group: root
# This variable is a toggle for enabling/disabling the automated
# setting of an owner or group (specified in variables `deb12cis_unowned_owner`
# and 'deb12cis_ungrouped_group') for all unowned or ungrouped files and

# warning with a list of the unowned and ungrouped files and directories,
# asking the user to manually assign ownership.

## Control 7.1.13 - Ensure SUID and SGID files are reviewed
# This variable is a toggle for enabling/disabling the automated removal
# of the SUID bit from all files on all mounts. Setting this variable to 'false'
# will only display a warning.

## Control 7.2.9 -Ensure no duplicate group names exist
# The minimum and maximum UIDs to be used for specifying
# non-system users (Those who usually have an home directory in
# /home, have a shell set and hence can login) can either be
# discovered automatically via logins.def or set manually
# in this file
# If min/maxx UIDs are to be discovered automatically,
# set this variable to `true`, otherwise to `false`
# and specify the options `min_int_uid` and `max_int_uid`.
deb12cis_discover_int_uid: true
# This variable sets the minimum number from which to search for UID
# Note that the value will be dynamically overwritten if variable `discover_int_uid` has
# been set to `true`.

## Control 7.2.10 - Ensure local interactive user dot files access is configured
# This variable is a toggle foe enabling/disabling the automated modification of
# permissions on dot files.
# Possible values are `true` and `false`.
